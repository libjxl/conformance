TITLE
-----

 ITU-T T.24 (06/1998) - Standardized digitized image set
 (CD-04 edition)

Test images have played an important role throughout the development of Group 3
and Group 4 facsimile. This digitized test chart set has been prepared with the
goal of providing a standard set of images to facsimile experimenters. The set
includes images that have been used over the years plus new images that are
applicable for gray scale and color. The standard set of images will provide a
consistent baseline for further work; for example, results of compression
algorithm experiments and image quality tests can be compared by a broad range
of users, knowing that the input image data is identical

This digitized test chart set is an integral part of ITU-T Rec. T.24 and is
published with it. The two CD-ROMs include a set of digitized images with
different resolutions. A detailed description is given in T.24 for each test
chart.
